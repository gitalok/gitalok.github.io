-  We were seeing false failures on Two locations and other two locations were workign fine......i.e. while monitoring a record site was UP but due to processing issues code was not able to work as desigred...
- We were seeing process was CPU bound
- Python has its own constraints its single threaded due to GIL
- Due to this multicore hypervisor systems were detoriating perforamnce of pyton code as there is high ammount of context switching from one CPU to another...
- After referring blogs and doing research we pinned the process to one CPU which immediately solved the whole problem for the current load..
- It was magical and onshore team shared they have never seens such graphs since long time on the boxes where issue was seen..
----they called of maintaince window..planeed around this issue by taking some other route....
$50K for that month...


We have listed various action items to eventually improve this including both short and long term solution...
 
 
Long Term Solutions
    Upgrade python and required framework to python 3.x. 
    Move sitebacker pools to new traffic service platform.
	

	

Global interpreter lock, or GIL, is a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This lock is necessary mainly because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe.
